---------Sale finder-----------

what i am thinking atm:
program asks user for a webpage link and their email
will send a email to user when the price of the item gets lower or sold out

will scrape website for $ signs if nmber after it changes sned email
scrape twice a day??
how to store data??? (webpages to scrape) mongodb????

some webpages like amazon have multiple $ what do?
dont wanna use html elements since they can change

need requests, bs4, html5lib.....

host on aws?
google chrome extension????

ok need to use html elements to find price too hard to single out which $ is the real price
this means need to hardcode per webpage lol
can do this for webpages i visit a lot
store in hash table?

writes scraper.data to a text file
read text file to see if sale
if sale then send email, update price to new price
if not do nothing
